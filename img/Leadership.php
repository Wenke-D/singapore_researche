            <p class="text">Executive coaching is a one-to-one interactive process between a middle- or top-level
                professional (the “coachee”) and a certified coach. The general objective is to enable the coachee to
                achieve rapid and long lasting results that are most valuable for him/her and the company. Executive
                coaching is a process that is both very practical and efficient, and very respectful of each
                individual.</p>

                    engaging and empowering than any training. It can be of great help for anyone, and particularly for
                    Chinese people because their education and the corporate culture in Chinese companies do not foster
                    self development.</p>

                    This methodology was developed by Team Coaching International. Our coaches are accredited to perform
                    this methodology in China. In this case, the key development issues are identified by the team
                    during the process. The program begins with 1 or 2 days of workshop, followed by shorton-going
                    sessions planned for several months to accompany the changes.
